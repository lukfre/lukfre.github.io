## Can we truly trust LLM evaluation scores? 🤔

Multiple-Choice Question Answering is one of the most widely used benchmarks for assessing LLMs across domains like math, science, commonsense reasoning and general knowledge. 
Since answer choices are predefined, **evaluating models seems straightforward**. 
However, our latest research reveals that current evaluation strategies introduce inconsistencies that may lead to incorrect conclusions about model performance.

In our paper, "**Right Answer, Wrong Score: Uncovering the Inconsistencies of LLM Evaluation in Multiple-Choice Question Answering**", we conduct a systematic analysis of how different answer extraction methods influence reported accuracy. 
Our study highlights **several critical challenges that affect the reliability** of LLM evaluation.

**Our Key Findings**:  
  1. Traditional evaluation strategies **underestimate** LLM performance 
  2. A **trade-off exists between enforcing** format constraints (for easy evaluation) and **allowing** free-form text (for better reasoning)
  3. LLM-based answer **extractors** are **prone to systematic errors**

We show that the way in which answers are extracted can significantly impact reported accuracy, raising concerns about the robustness of existing MCQA benchmarks. 
**Our findings highlight the need for more reliable and standardized evaluation strategies to ensure fair model comparison**.
