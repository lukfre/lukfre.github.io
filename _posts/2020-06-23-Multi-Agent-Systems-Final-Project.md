This project features a simulation of small robots that collaborate on complex tasks through emergent behavior. 
The robots implement simple avoidance and following algorithms, demonstrating how sophisticated group behaviors can emerge without direct communication between agents.
Their objective was to "clean" the central area, putting all the cans close to the walls in the least amount of time.
