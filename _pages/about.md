Hi! :wave: My name is Luca Gioffré (for those who can read it, the phonetic transcription is **[lˈuka d͡ʒoffrˈe]**).


I'm a PhD Student in Natural Language Processing at [SapienzaNLP](https://nlp.uniroma1.it/) in Sapienza University in Rome :it:. 
Before that, I graduated in Sapienza twice, with a Bachelor degree in Engineering in Computer Science and Automatic Systems and a Master degree in Engineering in Computer Science (although I changed my study plan quite a lot to be more AI-focused). 

This is where I share my academic work, personal projects and anything else I find interesting with the world!
